### Update Checks and Your Privacy

If you have updateCheck set to 'yes' in the config file, which is the default (and recommended) setting, your LibreKB install will reach out to librekb.com to check if an update is available. Your server's IP address and current version are reported to librekb.com. No other data is submitted. If you do not wish for this to happen, set updateCheck to 'no' in the config file. If you decide to disable updateCheck, please check for updates on a routine basis, as updates may contain important security improvements or bug fixes.
